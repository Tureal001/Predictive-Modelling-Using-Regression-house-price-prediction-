I developed a predictive modeling project to estimate house prices using machine learning. I performed data cleaning, feature preprocessing, and trained multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) using scikit-learn. By evaluating performance with MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics, I identified Random Forest as the best model, achieving strong predictive accuracy and revealing key features that drive housing prices.
